Software that calculates the necessary information for the electronic infrastructure of electric charging stations to be built by a private company in Istanbul, since there is no data on electric cars in Turkey, using various realistic probability distributions. Software that creates a realistic probabilistic distribution of models of electric cars in Istanbul, accordingly battery capacities, charging times and drivers' charging behavior.

According to the research, there are two types of DC and two types of AC current car charging stations, a total of four. They are divided into 50 kWh DC, 90 kWh DC, 7.4 kWh AC and 22 kWh AC. The prices per minute for all of them according to the energy they consume are given below.


The data generated about the charging station, whose current type and amount of energy to be supplied are selected, automatically creates an excel file. This excel file is downloaded to the area where the code file is located on the device.

# Usage

When the button related to the electric vehicle charging station, whose current type and energy level is selected, is pressed, realistic data is generated and graphics are formed.
